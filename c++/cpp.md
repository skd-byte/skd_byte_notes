# Book: A Tour to C++

## Introduction

### Start
- Core Langauage Features: Char and Int
- Standard Library Components: Vector and Map
- C++ Statically Typed Language: Menas type of every entity(object, value, name and expression) must be known to the compiler at its point of use. the type of an object determine the set of operations applicable to it
- Type of Function: Return Type and sequence of argument type 
    - `Ex- double get(const vector<double>&vec, int index) // type: double(const vector<double&>, int)`
    - Function Can be member of class , then name of calss also part of the function type, `type: char&Tring::(int)`
- Function overloading
    ```c++
    void print(int,double);
    void print(double, int);
    print(0,0); // compiler erro : ambiguous
    ```
### Types, Variables and Arithmetic
- A ***declaration*** is a statement that introduces an entity into the program. It specifies the type for the entity
    - A ***type*** defines a set of possile values and a set of operation (for an object)
    - An ***object*** is some memory that holds a value of some type
    - A ***value*** is a set of bits interpreted according to a type
    - A ***variable*** is a name object
- We can use \` this in long literals ex 3.14159\`263535
- Char variable is of the natural size to hold a character on given machine (typically 8-bit)
- The conversion used in expression are called ***the usuall arithmetic conversion*** aim to ensure that expression are computed at the highest precision of its operands.
- **Order of evaluation** The order of evaluation is left-to right for `x.y, x->y, x(y), x[y], x<<y, x>>y, x&&y, and x||y`. For assignments `(e.g., x+=y)`, the order is right-to-left. For historical reasons realated to optimization, the order of evaluation of other expressions `(e.g., f(x)+g(y))` and of function arguments `(e.g., h(f(x),g(y)))` is unfortunately unspecified.

    > **Note:** Evaluation and Associtaivty both are different

### Initialization
- ex
    ```c++  
    double d1 = 2.3;
    double d2 {2.3};
    double d3 = {2.3}; // the = is optional with {...}
    complex<double>z2 {d1,d2}
    complex<double>z3 = {d1, d2} // the = is optional with {...} 
    ```
- {} this saves you from conversion that losse information
    - ex, int i1 = 7.8 // i becomes 7 (surprise?)
    - ex, int i2{7.8} // error: floating-point to iteger conversion 
    - unfortunately, conveersion that loose information, ***narrowing conversions***, such as double to int and int to char are allowed and implitcly applied.
- Don"t need to state its type explicitly when it can be deduced from the initializer
    - auto b = true; // a bool
    - auto ch = 'x'; // a char
    - use in generic programming where the long type names and the exact type of an object can be hard for programmer to know

### Scope and Initialization
- Scope
    - Local Scope - Declared in a function or lambda is called a local name.
    - Class Scope- Class Member Name, outside of any function, lambda or enum class 
    - Namespace Scope - outside of any function, class, or enum class.
- For a namespace object the point of destruction is the end of the program, For a member the point of destruction is determine by the point of destruction oth object of which it is a member


### Constants
- Two notions of immutability
    - ***const***: "I promise not to change this value". The compiler enforces the promise made by const. The value of a *const* can be calculated at run time.
        ```c++
        const int runtimeValue = std::rand();  // OK, value not known at compile time
        runtimeValue = 5;  // Error: cannot assign to const variable
        ```
        > **Note:** If a runtime-initialized const variable is placed in read-only memory, it triggers a memory protection fault (segmentation fault) when written to at runtime.

    - ***constexpr***: to be evaluated at compile time, to allow placement of data in read only memory, the value of a contexpr must be calculated by the compiler
        ```c++
        constexpr int compileTimeValue = 42;         //OK
        constexpr int bad = std::rand();             //Error: rand() is not constexpr
        ```
        - Funtion to be usable in a *constant exppression*, must define contexpr
            ```
            constexpr double square(double x){return x*x;}
            constexpr double max1 = 1.4*square(17);// ok, evaluated at compiletime
            constexpr double max1 = 1.4*square(17);// error: var is not a constant expression
            const double max3 =1.4*square(var);// ok, may be evaluated at runtime
            ```
        - contexpr function can be used for non constant argument, so we can use the same funcntion for constexpr and for variables, without defining two.
        > **Note:** c++20, consteval introduce, if we want only be evaluated at compile time then define with **consteval**
        - contexpr or consteval functions cannot modify non-local variables, but it can have loop[s and use its own local variable

### Pointers, Array and Refernces

- Pointers and Array
    - In declaration
        - [] means: **array of**
        - * menas:  **pointer to**
        - & means   **refernce to**
    - In expression
        - * means: **contents of**
        - & means: **address of**
- C++ rang-for statement, for loops that traverse a sequence in the simplest way
    ```c++
    void print()
    {
        int v[]={0,1,2,3,4,5};
        for(auto x:v) // for each x in v
         cout << x << '\n';

        for(auto x:{10,21,32,35})
            cout << x << '\n';

        for(auto& x:v) // add 1 to each x in v
        {
            ++x;
            cout << x << '\n';
        }   
    }
    ```
- Declarator operators
    ```c++
    T a[n] // T[n]: a is an array of n Ts
    T* p   // T*: p is a pointer to T
    T& r   // T&: r is a reference to T
    Tf(A)  // T(A), is a funtion argument of type A and return type T
    ```
- Null Pointer
    ```c++
    Link<Record>*Ist = nullptr; // pointer to a link to a Record 
    int x = nullptr; //error:nullptr id a ponter not an integer
    ```

### Tests

- Like a for-statement, an if-statement can introduce a variable and test it.
    ```C++
    if(auto n = v.size(); n!=0) // the integer n defined for use within the if-statement and intialized with v.size
    {
        // ...we get here if n!=0
    }

    // simplified version
     if(auto n = v.size())
    {
        // ...we get here if n!=0
    }
    ```

### Mapping to hardware

- Assignments
    - An assignment of built-in type is a simple machine copy operation, 'int x =2; int y=3', both are independent object
    - Assignement to a refernce, does not change what the reference refers to but assigns to the referenced object
        ```c++
        int x = 2;
        int y = 3;
        int& r =x;
        int& r2 = y;
        r = r2; // read through r2, write through r: x becomes 3
        ```
    - To access the value pointed to by a pointer, you use *; that is automatically (implicitly) done for a refernce.

- Initilization
    - Initialization differs from assignment. In general, for an assignment to work correctly, the assigned-to object must have a value. On the other hand, the task of initialization is to make an uninitialized piece of memory into a valid object
    - You can use = to initialize a reference but please donâ€™t let that confuse you. `int& r = x;      // bind r to x (r refers to x)`This is still initialization and binds r to x, rather than any form of value copy.
    > **Note:** The basic semantics of argument passing and function value return are that of initialization. 

- Ex
    - Initialization
        ```c++
        // Creating a variable and giving it a value at the same time.
        int x = 10;           // Initialization (built-in type)
        std::string s = "hi"; // Initialization (calls constructor)
        ```
    - Assignment
        ```c++
        // Changing the value of an already initialized variable.
        x = 20;               // Assignment (built-in type: overwrite)
        s = "hello";          // Assignment (calls assignment operator)
        ```

## User Defined Types

### Introduction
- The C++ abstraction mechanism are primarily designed to let programmers design and imp[lement their own type.
- ***User-defined types (classes and enumeration)*** are less error prone and easy to use than built-in types
- structure 
    ```c++
    struct Vector
    {
        int sz;
        double *elem;
    };


    void vector(Vector& v, int s)
    {
        v.elem = new double[s];
        v.sz =  s;
    }

    void f(Vector v, kVector& rv, Vector* pv)
    {
        int i1 = vsz;    // access through name
        int i2 = rv.sz;  // access through reference
        int i3 = pv->sz; //access through the pointer
    }
    ```
### Classes
- A tighter connection between the representation and the operation is needed for a user-defined type to have all the properties expected of a **real-type**. To do that we have to distinguish between the interface to a type (to be used by all) and its implementation (which has access to the otherwise inaccssible data). The language mechnaism of for that is called a class.
- The interface defined by public member of the class and private member only accessible only through that interface.
    > '***Note:*** Vector(int s):elem{new double[s]},sz{s}{}' member **initializer list**, can only be used in a constructor.
    ```c++
    class Vector {
    public:
        Vector(int s):elem{new double[s]},sz{s}{} //contruct a vector
        double& operator[](int i){return elem[i];} //element access: subscripting
        int size(){return sz;}
    private:
        doouble* elem; // pointer the elemennts 
        int sz // the number of elements
    }

    double read_and_sum(int s)
    {
        Vector v(6);
        for(int i=0; i<v.size(); ++i)
            cin >>v[i];
        
        double sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<v.size(); ++i)
            sum +=v[i];

        return sum;
    }
    ```

### Unions
- Occupies only as much space as its largest element

    ```c++
    struct Entry{
        str name;
        Type t;
        Node* p; // use p if t==ptr
        int i;   // use i if t==num
    }

    union Value{
        Node* p;
        int i;
    };

    struct Entry{
        str name;
        Type t;
        Value v;
    }
    ```
    > **Note:** shoul not use naked union, alway use with type or call it tagged union

- **varaint**, standard library type can eliminate most direct use of unions, ` variant<Node*, int>, holds_alternative<int>(pe->v),get<int>`

    ```c++
    struct Entry{
        string name;
        variant<Node*, int> v;
    }

    void f(Entry *pe)
    {
        if(holds_alternative<int>(pe->v))
            cout << get<int>(pe->v);
    }
    ```

### Enumerations
- Ex
    ```c++
    enum class Color {red, blue, green};
    enum class traffic_light{green, yellow, red};
    Color x = red; //error: which red?
    Color y = Traffic_light::red; //error:that red is not a Color
    Color z = Color::red; //ok

    int i = Color:: red //error: Color::red is not an int
    Color c = 2 //initialization error:2 is not a color
    ```
    > ***Note:*** enum - allow implicit conversion, enum class not allow implicit conversion - only explixit conversion allowed, means class after enum specifies that an enumeration is *strongly typed*. Also using enum class also specifies thier scope, menas being separate types

    ```c++
    Color x = Color{5}; // ok, but verbose
    Color y{6}; //also ok
    ```
- By default **enum class** has only assignment, intialization and comparison defined. However an enumeartion is user defined type, so we can define operator for it:

    ```c++
    Traaffic_light& operator++(Traffic_light& t)
    {
        switch(t){
            case Traffic_loght::green: return t=Traffic_light::yellow;
            case Traffic_light::yellow return t=Traffic_light::red;
            case Traffic_light::red return t=Traffic_light::green;
        }
    }

    Traffic_light next = ++light; // next becomes Traffic_light::green
    ```

- dont want to explicitly qualify enmuerator names and want enumerator values to be ints (without need for an expliti conversion) remove the **class** from enum.
    ```c++
    enum Color {red, green, blue};
    int col =  green; // col get 1
    ```

### Advice
- Organize related data into structures
- Prefer enum class over plain enum
- Avoid naked unions
- define contructors to gurantee and simplyfy the intitialization of class
- Define operation on enumerations for safe and simple use

## Modularity

### Introduction
- A ***declaration*** specifies all that's need to use a function or a type. `double sqrt(double);`

### Separate compilation
- A .cpp file that is compiled by i self is called a **translation unit**.

    ```plantuml
    @startuml

    rectangle "Vector.h Interface" as VectorInterface
    rectangle "Vector.cpp \n #include "Vector.h"" as VectorImplementation
    rectangle "user.cpp \n #include "Vector.h"" as UserCode

    UserCode -up-> VectorInterface
    VectorImplementation -up-> VectorInterface

    @enduml
    ```
### Modules (C++20)

- Ex
    ```c++
    export modules vector; // defining the module called "vector"

    export class Vector {
    public:
        Vector (int s);
        double& operator[](int i);
        int size();
    private:
        double* elem;
        int sz;
    };

    Vector::Vector(int s):elem{new double[s]}, sz{s}{}

    double& Vector::operator[](int i)
    {
        return elem[i];
    }

    int Vector::size()
    {
        return sz;
    }

    export bool operator==(const Vector& v1, const Vector& v2)
    {
        if(v1.size()!=v2.size())
        {
            return false;
        }
            
        for(int i = 0; i<v1.size(); ++i)
        {
            if(v1[i]!=v2[i])
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

- This defines a module called vector, which export the class vector, all is member functions, and the non-member function defining operator ==.

    ```c++
    // file user.cpp

    import Vector; // get Vector's interface
    include <cmath> // get the standard-library math function interface including sqrt()

    double sqrt_sum(Vector& v)
    {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i=0; i!=v.size(); ++i)
            sum+std::sqrt(v[i]);
        return sum;
    } 

    ```
- #include has many problems as follows
    - Compilation time: will be processed by the compiler in every trnsalation unit
    - Order dependencies: If we #include header1.h before header2.h the declarations and macros in header1.h might affect the meaning of the code in header2.h. 
    - Transitivity: All code that is needed to express a declaration in a header file must be present in that header file. This leads to massive code bloat as header

- module benfits
    - A module is compiled once only
    - Two modules can be imported in either order without changing their meaning.
    - If you import or #include something into a module, users of your module do not implicitly gain access to (and are not bothered by) that: import is not transitive.
    - The effects on maintainability and compile-time performance can be spectacular.

### Namespaces
- Ex
    ```c++
    void my_code(vector<int>&x, vector<int>&y)
    {
        using std::swap;  // use the std library swap
        //...
        swap(x,y);  // std::swap
        other::swap(x,y); // some other swap
    }
    ```

- A **using**-declaration makes a name from a namespace usable as if itwas declared in the scope in which it appears: `using std::swap`
- To gain access to all names in the std library namespace, we can use a **using**-directive: `using namespace std`

### Error Handling

#### Exceptions
- What ought to be done when we try to access an element that is out of range for the vector example we did?
    - **Vector::operato[]()** can detect an attempted out of range access and throw an **out_ofrange** exception.

    ```c++
    double& Vector::operator[]()
    {
        if(i<0||i>=size())
        {
            throw out_of_rangw{"Vector::operator[]"};
        }
        return elem[i];
    }
    ```

 - The **throw** trnasfer control to a handler for exception of type **out_of_rnage** in some function that directly or indirectly called **Vector::operator[]()**. To do that, the implementation will unwind the function call stack as needed to get back to the context of that caller, functions as needed to get back to caller that has expressed interest in handling that kind of exception, invoking destructors along the was as needed.

    ```c++
    void f(Vector&v)
    {
        //....
        try{ // exceptions here are handled by the handler defined below
            v[v.size()] = 7; // try to access beyond the end of v
        }
        ctach(out_of_range& err) { // oops: out_of_range error, caught by reference and what() func to print the error
            // .. handle range error
            cerr << err.what()<<\"\n";
        }
    }
    ```
- The main technique for making error handling simple and systematic (RAII).
    > **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: The basic idea behind is for a constructor to acquire all resources necessary for a class to operarte and have the destructor relase all resources, thus making resource release guranteed and implicit.

- A functions that should never throw an exception can be declared **noexcept**
    ```c++
    void user(int sz) noexcept
    {
        Vector v(sz);
        iota(&v[0], &v[sz],1);
    }
    ```
    - If all good intent and planning fails, so that `user()` still throws, `std::terminate()` is called to immediately terminate the program.

#### Invariants
- Use of exception to check a ***precondition***, like checking function argument and refusing to act. 
- example if we say "elem points to an array of sz doubles" but we only said that in a comment. Such  statement of what is asssumed to be true for a class is called a **class invariant**, or simply  a **invariant**.
-  It is the job of a contructor to establish the invariant for its class(so that the memeber functions can rely on it) and for the member function to make sure that the invariant holds when they exit.

- **Invariant**: A rule that an object must always follow, defining its valid state. It's the class's internal promise to itself.
    - Example: For a BankAccount object, the invariant is "the balance is always non-negative." Every method must ensure this rule is never broken.
- **Precondition:** A rule that a function's caller must follow for the function to work correctly. It's a promise from the user to the function.
    - Example: A divide(a, b) function has the precondition that b is not zero. The function trusts this and can proceed with the division without checking for a zero denominator.

- `Vecotor v(-27);`, this is likely to cause chaos.
- appropriate definition:
    ```c++
    Vector::Vector(int s)
    {
        if (s<0)
            throw length_error{"Vector Constructor: negative size"};
        elem = new double[s];
        sz = s;
    }
    ```
- if a **new** can't find memory to allocate, it trhows a **std::bad_alloc**.
    ```c++
    void test()
    {
        try{
            Vector v(-27);          
        }
        catch(std::length_error& err){
            // handle negative size
            cerr << "test failed:length error\n";
            throw; //rethrow
        }
        catch (std::bad_alloc& err){
            // handle memory exhaustation
            std::terminate();
        }
    }
    ```
- "rethrowing" an exception is the process of catching an exception, performing some actions (like logging or cleanup), and then throwing the same exception again to be caught by a different catch block higher up the call stack.


- The Two Core Ideas
    - **Don't use try-catch blocks for simple cleanup**: In C++, you often have to handle things like closing files, releasing memory, or unlocking a mutex. Manual try-catch blocks are a clumsy way to do this because you have to write the cleanup code in multiple placesâ€”once for a successful path and again for a failed (exception) path.

    - **Use RAII instead**: RAII is a C++ technique where you wrap a resource (like a file handle or a pointer) inside a class. This class's constructor acquires the resource, and its destructor automatically releases it. The C++ language guarantees that the destructor will be called when the object goes out of scope, whether the function ends normally or because an exception was thrown.

    ```c++
    #include <fstream>
    #include <iostream>

    void process_file_raii(const std::string& filename) {
        // The resource is acquired in the constructor
        // If the file can't be opened, the constructor throws an exception
        std::fstream file(filename);

        if (!file) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Could not open file.");
        }

        // No try-catch block needed for cleanup!
        read_data_from_stream(file); 

        // When the function returns or an exception is thrown,
        // 'file' goes out of scope, and its destructor is called automatically,
        // which closes the file handle.
    }
    ```
- C++ constructors establish a class's internal rules (invariants) by correctly acquiring resources, while destructors maintain those rules by guaranteeing resources are released, even during errors. This core mechanism, known as RAII, is central to robust C++ resource management.

#### Error Handling Alternatives
- We return an error indicator(an "error code") when:
    - A failure is normal and expected
    - An immediate caller can reasonably be expected to handle the failure
- We trhow an exception when
    - An error is so rare
    - An error cannot be handled by an immediate caller. Instead the error has to percolate back to an ultimate caller. For ex, it is infeasible to have every function in an application reliably handle every a;;ocation failure or network outage.
        > **Note:** The C++ runtime system unwinds the stack, skipping over all the functions in the call chain until it finds a catch block that is prepared to handle that type of exception.
    - Not suitable return path, ex constructor
    - The function that found the error was callback
    - An error implies that some "undo action" is needed
    - The error has to be transmitted up a call chgain to an ultimate caller
- We terminate when
    - An error cannot recover
    - non-trival error is detected

    >**Note:** One way to ensure termination is to add noexcept to a function so that a throw from anywhere in the functionâ€™s implementation will turn into a terminate().  Ex.  If a function marked noexcept calls another function that does throw an exception, or if it throws an exception itself, the C++ runtime environment will immediately call std::terminate().
    > **Note:** If an exception escapes a noexcept function during stack unwinding, the runtime stops unwinding and immediately calls std::terminate(), skipping destruction of any remaining stack objects.


#### Assertions
- The standard library offers the debug macro, assert(), to assert that a condition must hold at run time. `assert(p!=nullptr);  // p must not be the nullptr`

    ```c++
    enum class Error_action { ignore, throwing, terminating, logging };       // error-handling alternatives

    constexpr Error_action default_Error_action = Error_action::throwing;     // a default

    enum class Error_code { range_error, length_error };                           // individual errors

    string error_code_name[] { "range error", "length error" };                    // names of individual errors

    template<Error_action action = default_Error_action, class C>
    constexpr void expect(C cond, Error_code x) // take "action" if the expected condition "cond" doesn't hold
    {
    if constexpr (action == Error_action::logging)
        if (!cond()) std::cerr << "expect() failure: " << int(x) << '' << error_code_name[int(x)] << '\n';
    if constexpr (action == Error_action::throwing)
        if (!cond()) throw x;
    if constexpr (action == Error_action::terminating)
        if (!cond()) terminate();
    // or no action
    }

    double& Vector::operator[](int i)
    {
        expect([i,this] { return 0<=i && i<size(); }, Error_code::range_error);
        return elem[i];
    }
    ```

#### Static Assertions
- We can also perform simple checks on most properties that are known at compile time and report failure to meet our expectation as compiler error message.
    ```c++
    static_assert(4<=sizeof(int),"Integers are too small");

    constexpr double C = 2999792.458; // km/s

    void f(double speed)
    {
        constexpr double local_max = 160.0/(60*60);        // 160 km/h == 160.0/(60*60) km/s

        static_assert(speed<C,"can't go that fast");       // error: speed must be a constant
        static_assert(local_max<C,"can't go that fast");   // OK

        // ...
    }
    ```

- One important use ofÂ static_assertÂ is to make assertions about types used as parameters in generic programming
    ```c++
    template <typename T>
    void only_accept_integers(T value) {
        // This static_assert checks if T is an integer type at compile time.
        static_assert(std::is_integral_v<T>, "Error: This function only works with integer types.");

        std::cout << "The value is: " << value << std::endl;
    }

    int main() {
        only_accept_integers(10);        // OK: T is int
        only_accept_integers(50L);       // OK: T is long
        // only_accept_integers(3.14);    // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: T is double
        // only_accept_integers("hello"); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: T is const char*

        return 0;
    }
    ```

#### Argument passing
- Default function argument
    ```c++
    void print(int value, int base =10);
    print(x,16);
    print(x,60);
    print(x);
    ```

#### Function Argument and Return Values
- Passing information to and from functions
    - Is an object copied or shared?
    - If an object is shared, is it mutable?
    - Is an object moved, leaving an "empty object" behind?

#### Value return
- Ex

    ```c++
    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& x, const Matrix& y)
    {
        Matrix res;
        //...
        return res;
    }

    Matrix m1, m2;
    //..
    Matrix m3=m1+m2; // no copy
    ```
- A matrix may be very large and expensive to copy even on mordern hardware. So we dont copy, we give matrix a move contructor and very cheaply move the Matrix out of operator+()
    ```c++
    Matrix * add(-cont Matrix& x, const Matrix& y)
    {
        Matrix* p = new Matrix;
        //..
        return p;
    }

    Matrix m1, m2;
    //..
    Matrix*m3 = add(m1,m2); //just copy a pointer
    //..
    delete m3; //easily forgotten
    ```

    > **Note:**returning a large object using pointer to its common in older code, and major source of hard to find errors. Dont write such code.

- The return type of a function can be deduced from its value, ex`auto mul(int i, double d){return i*d;} // here "auto means deduced the rerun type" `


#### Structural Binding
- A function can return only a single value, but that value can be a class object with many members. This allows us to effieciently return many values.

    ```c++
    struct Entry {
        string name;
        int value;
    }

    Entry read_entry(istream& is)
    {
        string s;
        int i;
        is >> s >> i;
        return {s,i}; // Imp- is used to contruct the Entry return type
    }

    auto e = read_entry(cin);

    cout << "{"<< e.name<<","<<e.value<<"}\n";
    // another method - this strunctural binding
    auto [n,v] = read_entry(is);
    cout << "{"<< n<<","<<v<<"}\n";
    ```
- Here, return {s,i} is used to contruct the Entry return type
- The `auto[n,v]` declares two local variables n and v with their types deduced from read_entry()'s return type.  This mechanism for giving local names to members of a class object is called **structural binding**.

- When structured binding is used for a class with no private data. There muste be the same number of names defined for the binding as there are nonstatic data members of the class.
    ```c++
    complex<double>z={1,2};
    auto[re, im] = z+2 // re =3; im =2
    ```

### Advice
- Donâ€™t apply noexcept thoughtlessly
- Use an assertion mechanism to provide a single point of control of the meaning of failure
- Let a constructor establish an invariant, and throw if it cannot
